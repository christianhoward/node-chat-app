# node-chat-app
This is my chat application following [Andrew Mead](http://www.mead.io/)'s Complete Node.js Developer Course on Udemy. This repo is used purely for learning exercises and the course content should not be interpreted as something I've created on my own.

The chat app uses the Socket.IO library so that users can join a room and chat with individuals in that specific room. Current features in place include: join a room, send messages in that room, and send geolocation information. As users enter and leave the room, the room list updates and an admin message announces the change.

Future features that could be implemented include: making rooms case-insensitive, making usernames unique, and adding a list of currently active rooms to the join page.
